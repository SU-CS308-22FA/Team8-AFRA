## :warning: How to report bugs? 
After finding a bug, here are some steps you should follow...

1. Write down what happened, and your thoughts on what you think caused it. 
2. Try to reproduce it by understanding what happened and when the bug happened. At this step documenting the action is key, you can do it by taking a video or screenshots. 
3. If it can be reproduced -> Simply explain what happens when it occurs and what triggers it.
4. If it can't be reproduced -> Try to explain as much as you can so we can try to find a testing scenario to see the bug in action.
5. Here is a template to make things simpler for you => [Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nIhCb6WBJm_DoLVL-eXjm0CvYocSIvEVLZNPki6TEkI/edit?usp=sharing)
